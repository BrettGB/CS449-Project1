HOW TO RUN AND EXPERIENCE ALL OF THE FEATURES OF THE APPLICATION:
  
  Simply open the app using Android Studio and run it.
  
  To use the app, select a scale from the drop-down.
  
  Then select your key. Once both are selected, the submit button will appear.
  Click the submit button and you will see the scale for your selected scale and key.
  You can select a new scale and key combination and click submit for that scale.
  There is also a drop-down in the top right that lets you change to the info screen,
    and change back to the home screen.
  The home button in the top left will bring you to a new home screen--it can be used
    to clear any selections made.
